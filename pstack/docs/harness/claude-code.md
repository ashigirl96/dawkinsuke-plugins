# pstack in Claude Code

pstack skills use Cursor names. In Claude Code, read this file once per session, then map each Cursor name in a skill with the tables below. `<pstack>` means the folder that holds `skills/` and `docs/`. If a Cursor field has no row, drop it and say so. Never pass a field or value the tool schema rejects.

## Tools

| Cursor | Claude Code |
| --- | --- |
| `Task` | `Agent` |
| `AskQuestion` | `AskUserQuestion`. In `-p` mode it is absent, so ask in plain text. |
| Open a todolist | Use `TodoWrite` if the session offers it. Otherwise keep the list in your reply and update it at each phase. |
| Run another pstack skill (`/name` or "the **name** skill") | Call the `Skill` tool with `dawkinsuke:<name>`. When you tell the user to type it, write `/dawkinsuke:<name>`. |
| `Grep`, `Glob` | `Bash` with `rg` when the session has no `Grep` or `Glob`. |
| `deslop` from `cursor-team-kit` | The `simplify` skill. |
| `control-ui` from `cursor-team-kit` | The `agent-browser` skill. |
| `control-cli` from `cursor-team-kit` | The `run` skill. |
| Cursor's built-in `create-skill` | The `writing-for-agents` skill. |
| Cursor's `/loop` | Claude Code's `/loop`. |

## Subagent fields

| Cursor | Claude Code |
| --- | --- |
| `subagent_type: generalPurpose` | `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` |
| `poteto-agent`, `comment-sicko` | `dawkinsuke:poteto-agent`, `dawkinsuke:comment-sicko` |
| `readonly: true` | `subagent_type: "Explore"`. It keeps `Bash`, so the brief also says "do not edit files", and you check `git status` afterward. |
| `readonly: false` | `general-purpose`. It keeps the session's MCP servers. |
| `environment: "cloud"` | `isolation: "worktree"`. Name the branch or commit the worker checks out. |
| `environment: "local"` | Omit. |
| `cloud_base_branch: <b>` | Tell the worker to check out `<b>` first. |
| `run_in_background: true` | Omit. Subagents run in the background by default and notify you when they finish. |
| `resume` | Spawn a new agent and paste the earlier result into its brief. |
| `file_attachments` | List the paths in the brief. |

## Models

| Cursor | Claude Code |
| --- | --- |
| `claude-<family>-<version>-<effort>[-fast]`, such as `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` | `model: "opus"` and `effort: "xhigh"`. `model` takes only `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`. Drop `-fast`. |
| A `grok-*`, `cursor-grok-*`, or `composer-*` slug | `gpt-6.1-sol`, then map it with the next row. Map it before any family check, so its family is `gpt-*`. |
| A `gpt-*` or other non-Claude model, such as `gpt-6.1-sol` | Pass as `subagent_type` the `Agent` subagent type whose description says it delegates to that model, in place of `general-purpose` or `Explore`. Omit `model`, which that subagent ignores. For `readonly: true`, the brief says "do not edit files". If no subagent type names the model, omit `model` so the agent runs on the session model, and say so. A model's family is its name prefix, so `gpt-*` is a family apart from `claude-*`. |
| `auto` or `inherit-parent` | Omit `model`. |
| The `pstack-models.mdc` rule, `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` | `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md`. Claude Code loads it into every new session, so its role lines are already in context. If they are not, read the file. If the file or the role's line is missing, use the skill's default slug. |
| A role value `<model> <effort>`, such as `opus high` | `model: "opus"` and `effort: "high"`. |

## setup-pstack

Claude Code loads every `.md` file in `~/.claude/rules/` into each new session, so `setup-pstack` writes its rule there. Follow its steps with these changes:

- Detect. The detected models are the `model` values that the `Agent` tool schema lists, each with an effort from its `effort` values. Write a real model as `<model> <effort>`, such as `opus xhigh`. The effort is the last token, so the budget step works as written. Also detect each model that an `Agent` subagent type's description says it delegates to, and write it by its bare name, such as `gpt-6.1-sol`, with no effort. The budget step leaves it as is.
- Defaults. Map each default slug with the rows above: `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` is `opus xhigh`, and `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` is `gpt-6.1-sol`.
- Write. Write `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` with no frontmatter, then the comment lines, the `# budget` line, and one line per role from step 5. Overwrite the whole file. Never put the role lines in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`.

## Paths

| Cursor | Claude Code |
| --- | --- |
| `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/` | `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/` |
| `~/.cursor/plugins/`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | `~/.claude/plugins/`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, always-applied rules | `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md` when no `CLAUDE.md` exists. Claude Code never reads `.mdc` files. The model rule is the exception. See Models. |
| `https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/main/pstack/<path>` | `<pstack>/<path>` when that file exists. The plugin ships the skills, `docs/guide/`, and `README.md`. Read the local copy and never fetch it. Give the user the URL when they need a link. |
| Transcripts in `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts/` | `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`. The slug is the workspace path with each `/` and `.` changed to `-`, so `/Users/you/proj` is `-Users-you-proj`. The newest `.jsonl` directly in that folder is the current session. Its `<session>/subagents/` folder holds subagent transcripts. Read only this workspace's folder. |

## Cursor-only features

Claude Code has no Cursor Automations, Bugbot, Cursor cloud agents, or built-in PR tool. When a step needs one, put one line in your reply, `Skipped in Claude Code: <step>. <reason>.`, then go on to the next step. Do not stop, ask, or retry. When a later step needs what the skipped step made, such as a URL or a key, leave a placeholder and name it in the line.

| Cursor | Claude Code |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor Automations: routines, `update_state` routine calls, `api2.cursor.sh/automations` webhooks, routine wakes, and `SendToUser` secret requests | Skip with the line. |
| Bugbot | Bugbot comments on a GitHub PR are ordinary review threads, so triage them with the forge command that the step gives. Skip a step that starts, waits for, or configures Bugbot when the PR has no Bugbot check or comment. |
| Cursor cloud agents | `environment: "cloud"` maps to a worktree, as in Subagent fields. Skip a step that needs the cloud agent itself, such as its dashboard status or its own machine. |
| A built-in PR tool | Use the forge command that the step gives, such as `gh pr create`. That is not a skip, so write no line. |
